#2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
#What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

exponents= [0]*20
for num in range(1,20):
    x = 2
    divisors = []
    while x<=num:
        if(num%x==0):
            divisors.append(x)
            num /= x
            if (divisors.count(x)>exponents[x-1]):
                exponents[x-1] = divisors.count(x)
        else:
            x+=1
product = 1
for i in range(1,21):
    product *= i**exponents[i-1]
print(product)
