#The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
#What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

largest = 2                 #2 is the smallest prime
num = 600851475143
i = 3                       #The number we are checking is odd, so the smallest prime it could have is 3          
while i<(num//3):           #For efficiency, we are checking primes of the number after it has been divided by 3
    if num%i ==0:
        num /= i
        if i>largest:
            largest = i
    else:
        i+=1
if(num>largest):
    largest = num
print(largest)

#Answer: 6857
