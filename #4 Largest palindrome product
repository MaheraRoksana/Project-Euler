#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

def check_palindrome(number):
    number = str(number)
    for i in range(len(number)//2):
        if(number[i]!=number[len(number)-1-i]):
            return 0
    return 1

for i in range(100,1000):
    for j in range(100,1000):
        product = i*j
        if(check_palindrome(product)):
            if(product>largest):
                largest = product

#Answer: 906609
